The idea of generator balancing is a game to educate young teen to young adult about the process in large scale centralized
energy generation. The challenge is to balance the (supply) of the energy generation regarding the (demand).
the (offline) generator will need time to be turned on (transient time) to (steady state) and inserted to the grid (lock) with
correct phase.
sometimes it also fails (fail) and need to be restarted to transient time and to steady state once again.
The game will be divided into (10 rounds), with each demand gets higher and trickier number

User will interface input from (6 generators) each has (1 button) and (1 limit switch)
User will interface output from (1 monitor screen) for {(score), (demand), (supply), (grid_phase)} and , 
(6 LED strip in each generator) for indicating generator state, 
and (Light in Button in each generator)

Therefore there will be:
1. 6 generators with 8 attributes, 2 behavior: 
		-attributes: 
			1. power: 1,3,5,7,10,12
			2. fail_chance: 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%
			3. generator_number: 0,1,2,3,4,5
			4. states: "offline","transient","steady","lock","fail"
			5. button: 0,1
			6. limit_switch: 0,1
			7. pin_limit_switch: 
			8. pin_button: 
		-behavior:
			1. lights(states)
			2. changeState(states)
2. 1 main_control with 4 attributes:
		-attributes: 
			1. score: (if abs(supply-demand)<=3, score=+10, else score=+10-abs(supply-demand))
			2. demand: 1 /*round1*/,3/*round2*/,5/*round3*/,7/*round4*/,10/*round5*/,np.round(np.rand(1)*10)/*round6*/,np.round(np.rand(1)*15)/*round7*/,np.round(np.rand(1)*20)/*round8*/,np.round(np.rand(1)*30)/*round9*/,np.round(np.rand(1)*38)/*round10*/
			3. supply: Sum(if generator::states=="lock") 
			4. grid_phase: 1,2,3,4 
		-behavior:
			1. next_round()
			2. start_game()
			3. end_game()

Code development will be in python with serial communication to arduino nano in mainboard, taking input from generators and controlling actuators in generators

CPP (arduino Nano):
	1. akuisisi data:
		-button
		-limit_switch
	2. aktuator:
		-lights(states)
	3. Terima Serial dari Laptop untuk aktuator
	4. Olah data: main_control
